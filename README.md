This project is a horizontal tower defense game based on Plants vs Zombies.

**The project features 5 unique towers:**
Cannon - Fires a regular projectile
Cannon 2 - Fires two projectiles at once
Wall - Blocks enemies
Landmine - Instantly kills one enemy that touches it
Barricade - The last line of defense, losing two means you lose the game.

**It also includes 5 unique enemies:**
Default - The regular basic enemy
Stronger - A slightly stronger and slower variant
Fast - A slightly faster and weaker variant
Ranged - A variant that shoots projectiles at towers from a distance
Commander - A slightly more advanced enemy that attacks with shockwaves from a distance and does heavy hits. The shockwaves pierce through one tower.
